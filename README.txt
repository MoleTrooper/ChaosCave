This is an I Wanna Be the Guy fangame made by MoleTrooper, based on I Wanna Be the 
Studio Engine YoYoYo Edition v1.50. It is planned to contain a few screens of needle
and an avoidance boss.

You can get the GMS project on GitHub here: https://github.com/MoleTrooper/ChaosCave
All sprites aside from what comes with the engine are custom made. Please ask me
for permission if you would like to use them.

Information for testers using the GMS project:
You can move to a time in the avoidance by shooting (if debug keys are on).
This time is determined by the global.testTime variable, which is set in the create
event of objAVcontroller.
